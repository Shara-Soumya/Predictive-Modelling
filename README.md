# Predictive-Modelling
Hello,
This project is about predicting the price of a car based on its attributes that are both continuous and categorical. 
There is a lot of data cleaning and EDA involved along with model building using linear Regression model.
As the error values are not satisfying the assumptions of linear regression especialy due to heteroscedasticity, 
even after target variable transformation is done, Random forest regression has been used to improve the model performance on unseen data.
